# Siddharth | Generative AI & Machine Learning Engineer

Hi, I'm Siddharth — a Deep Learning and Generative AI Engineer focused on building production-grade, real-time voice agents, RAG pipelines, and intelligent multimodal systems. I blend my expertise across ML, systems programming, and deployment to develop solutions that push the boundaries of what's possible with AI.

## 💡 Areas of Expertise

* **Voice AI Systems**: Real-time speech-to-text and text-to-speech pipelines using Faster-Whisper, RealtimeTTS (Coqui, Kokoro, Orpheus), and VAD integration.
* **Conversational AI**: Building scalable voice/chat assistants using FastAPI, WebSockets, Redis, and LangChain.
* **RAG Pipelines**: End-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems using ChromaDB, Pinecone, and HuggingFace models.
* **Multimodal Agents**: Architecting intelligent agents capable of interacting via audio, text, and visual modalities.
* **Fullstack AI Deployment**: Scalable deployments with Docker, Kubernetes, FastAPI backends, Streamlit dashboards, and JavaScript frontends.
* **Data Engineering**: Structured PostgreSQL pipelines, memory & state tracking via Redis, session management, and async processing.
